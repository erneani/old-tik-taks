# Tik Tak Toe game (it's the right name)?

## An old simple game

This is just a Tik Tak Toe for my Web Development course. It's still in progress as I have spent a long time far from react.

## Some future ideas

Would be nice to create a back-end to implement the core DB logic, but this is for another day.

## What should be nice to do

It's nice to try implementing this Tik Tak Toe game directly on the terminal. This way, you can use a lot of programming logic to make it running as expected and can be a really nice project.
